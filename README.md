# This is Spring app CRM REST API, using Hibernate API and all CRUD methods with database.We was using POSTMAN REST CLIENT to test all HTTP REQUEST METHODS (GET,POST,PUT,DELETE).We created 2 JAVA CONFIG CLASSES, because we are using PURE JAVA CONFIG, NO XML.We also created our CUSTOM ERROR RESPONSE CLASS, CUSTOM EXCEPTION CLASS(CustomerNotFoundException class) and ExceptionHandler class.
